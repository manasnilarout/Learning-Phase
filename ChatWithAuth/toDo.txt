1) Create a simple one-to-one chat application using socket.io. This chat application should also capture the events like “other user is typing”.  

2) This chat application should also identify the user that it typing. It should have login and logout feature, with proper notification to other user who is in the chat. Something like “Aditya has logged out”, “Aditya has joined the chat etc” 

3) The chat should be real time and using socket, but for storing the chat history between two people. It should use mongodb. So, store the chat of users into mongodb (along with their username) , so that this can be retrived later by user by scrolling up. (just like facebook messenger)  Hint - use nodejs events to store the chat. Don’t disturb the usual flow of socket.io code by introduction mongoose save or any other mongoose function. Perform these database calls in a separate nodejs event. This is how realtime chat systems usually work.
